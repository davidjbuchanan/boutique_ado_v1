Goto https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template
    Use template
    Name repo
    Make public
    Open Gitpod (you'll need the Gitpod addon)

cli: pip3 install django
cli: django-admin startproject boutique_ado .
cli: touch .gitignore
    add *.sqlite3
    add *.pyc
    add __pycache__

In the file explorer now we'll see we have 3 new items: 
boutique_ado    manage.py   .gitignore   

cli: python3 manage.py runserver
    to check - looks good

cli: ^c
    close server

cli: python3 manage.py migrate
cli: python3 manage.py createsuperuser

cli: git status
cli: git remote -v
cli: git add .
cli: git commit -m "initial commit"
cli: git push

cli: pip3 install django-allauth

From allauth documentation copy and paste settings into settings.py file
    https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
    you need:
1)  'django.template.context_processors.request',           should already be there under TEMPLATES
    allows allauth and django to access the HTTP request object in our templates.
    E.g., if we wanted to access request.user or request.user.email in our django templates. We'll be able to do it with this context processor.
    It's required because the allauth templates which we'll see and customize later on use the request object frequently.
2)  AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS
        remove before and after dots
        see notes in the actual file
3)  from INSTALLED_APPS
        'django.contrib.sites',
            used by the allauth.socialaccount to create the proper callback URLs
        'allauth',
            this is the actual allauth app
        'allauth.account',
            allows all the basic account login/logout/registration/password resets
        'allauth.socialaccount'
            allows logins via social media
4)  add the following phrase after AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS section:
    SITE_ID = 1
5)  add the following phrase after SITE_ID = 1: 
    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'
    Note: by default allauth will send confirmation emails to any new accounts. We need to temporarily log those emails to the console so we can get the confirmation links.
6)  see below.

update urls.py (line 17 and 21) to give us the urls needed to login/logout etc

cli: python3 manage.py migrate  
    we added apps so now we have to make migrations

cli: python3 manage.py runserver
    see 404, goto /admin, login, click sites, click example, update domain name and display name. Save
        critical if you want to use social media authentication

cli: ^c

6 continued)  add the following phrases after EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'
    ACCOUNT_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD = 'username_email'
        The account authentication method is what tells allauth that we want to allow authentication using either usernames or emails.
    ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED = True
        email is required to register for the site.
    ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION = 'mandatory'
        Verifying your email is mandatory so we know users are using a real email.
    ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_EMAIL_ENTER_TWICE = True
        required to enter their email twice on the registration page
    ACCOUNT_USERNAME_MIN_LENGTH = 4
        a minimum username length of four characters.
    LOGIN_URL = '/accounts/login/'
        specifying a login url and a url to redirect back to after logging in.
    LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/'
        change to LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/success' for the test below , then change it back

cli: python3 manage.py runserver
    see 404, goto /accounts/login/.
    Login using the superuser id and password.
        See 'Verify Your E-mail Address' but this won't work because this id was created before installing allauth.
        Therefore, add email manually
        goto /admin, see all models listed, click email addresses, click add email address, enter id, generate email, check all boxes, save, logout
    goto /accounts/login/
    Login using the superuser id and password.
        see url ending in /success
        this proves authentication is working properly
        change the settings from '/success' back to '/'

cli: pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

cli:mkdir templates
    this produces a project level templates file for base.html (so not an app based templates directory)

cli:mkdir templates/allauth
    puts an allauth dr in the templates dr (both or which will be in the project level)

cli: git status

Customise the supplied allauth templates:
-   they live in the site-packages directory (see hello django repo on github)
cli: cp -r ../.pip-modules/lib/python3.8/site-packages/allauth/templates/* ./templates/allauth/
    cp - r which means to copy(cp) recursively (-r)
     ../ to go up one level from where we are right now
    .pip-modules/lib /python (press tab to autopoulate)
    /site-packages /allauth/templates
    /* copies everything in the directory
     ./templates/allauth/ is the destination you want to move to
-   If you want to use the standard allauth templates i.e. not customise them then delete from the templates/allauth dr
        delete openid
        delete tests
End (customise the supplied allauth templates)

cli: touch templates/base.html
    opens a file in the project level's template directory (i.e. not the app level)
    goto getbootstarp, vlick documentation, scroll to starter template, copy it paste it in to base,html
    add a line to base.html header: <meta http-equiv="X-UA-compatible" content="ie=edge">
        Will allow support of older Internet Explorer versions and eliminate validation errors when validating our HTML.
    Update title
    move script files to header

    Note: If you perform a search e.g. search for frog then the resultant url will end .gitpod.io/?q=frog. The q confirms the form is working as the form's name=q - see project level template/base.html

goto settings.py and underneath the STATIC_URL setting.
    add STATICFILES_DIRS = (os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),)
        Which is going to tell Django where all of our static files are located.
        It is worth noting that although normally we would also want to supply a static route setting here for Django's collect static utility to work.
        I'm not going to do that because it will interfere with setting up Amazon Web Services later on.
        Has to be a tuple, hence the brackets and comma at end
    add MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
    add MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')
        which is where all uploaded media files will go.

To allow Django to see the media (remember the background image with the girl is still not visible
    goto boutique_ado/urls.py
        import settings
        import the static function
            to add the MEDIA_URL to our list of URLs.
        then use the static function:
            add + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

cli: python3 manage.py runserver
    see:
        looks good - can see background image. The main site header is now visible on large viewports only. With the logo in the upper left the search bar in the middle and the My account and shopping bag links on the right.

cli: git status
    see:
        media
        static
cli: git add .
cli: git commit -m "completed home page header and css"
cli: And git push

Now we add header for small viewports and extend the header features (for all vp sizes) to allow users to sort
    goto templates/base.html
        add further navbar Code
        Note: this won't preview (i.e. python3 manage.py runserver) because of the Django Template Logic is not linked to anything so 404 error.

    cli: mkdir templates/includes
        a commonly occuring directory in larger web projects
        place to create HTMLsnippets and then include them in the base.html template using Django.
        Create 2 new files:
            main-nav.html
            mobile-top-header.html
    
    cli: python3 manage.py runserver
        see a responsive header with all functionality
end (Now we add header for small viewports ........... to allow users to sort)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------start Products app
    set up free shipping banner
        add free_shipping_threshold to base.html (which will then link to products app later) and class to base.css

download images from CI into media directory. Goto:
    https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/boutique_ado_images/tree/master/pics
    go back a page
    click clone or download
    click download zip
    goto c drive downloads on your computer
    right click 
    select Extract All..
    then drag and drop into media file

cli: python3 manage.py startapp products

goto settings.py    
    add products to INSTALLED_APPS

cli: mkdir products/fixtures
    Fixtures are used to load data very quickly into a django database so we don't have to do it all manually in the admin.
    Drag and drop the categories and products json files from the earlier download
        Read the json files on a reader, e.g. https://jsonformatter.org/
            Each item has a primary key; the model it'll use; a category id (which refers to the primary key) of one of the categories in the other fixture file.
            When we use these fixtures we'll first create the categories and then the productssince Django will need to know which category each product goes in.

Goto products/models.py
    add class for Category and Product
    Notes on code:
    Add a friendly name for the front end. Max length of 254. Null equals true and blank equals true so that the friendly name is optional.
    If you look at bed and bath in the categories fixture for example you'll see the friendly name is a bit nicer, but the name field gives us a
    programmatic way to find it in things like views and other code.
    create a string method: Which takes in the category model itself. And then returns self.name
    For the on_delete: set any products that use it to have null for this field rather than deleting the product.
    Each product requires a name, a description, and a price. But everything else is optional.

cli: python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-run
    identify any potential issues
        Error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'homeproducts'
            turns out I was missing a comma in the settings.py 
cli: python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-run
        Errors: Cannot use image field because Pillow is not installed
cli: pip3 install pillow
cli: python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-run
    no issues
cli: python3 manage.py makemigrations
    creates models
cli: python3 manage.py migrate --plan
    to see if there are any issues with the models
    no issues
cli: python3 manage.py migrate
    note: shouldn't use this command freely as it could migrate multiple apps

Goto products/admin.py
    import Product and Category models

So we've got our models created; our fixtures ready to go; our product images uploaded; and our migrations applied. The only thing left to do is actually use these fixtures.

cli: python3 manage.py loaddata categories
    see:
        the cli should show 9 objects installed onto Django
cli: python3 manage.py loaddata products
    see:
        the cli should show 172 objects installed onto Django

cli: python3 manage.py runserver
Goto /admin 
    see: 
        Products
        see:
            Categorys (intentional misspell) and Products 
       
cli: git status
    seetings.pv
    loads of images
    products
cli: git add .
cli: git commit -m "added products app, models and fixtures"
cli: git push

To fix the misspelling of Catagorys add the class Meta to products/models.py
    this update to the model doesn't require migration as there is no change to the class structure

cli: python3 manage.py runserver
Goto /admin 
    see:
        Products
        see:
            Categories (misspell corrected) and Products
            check products  
                see a massive vertical list of product names
                    To fix goto products/admin.py
                        add class ProductAdmin

cli: python3 manage.py runserver
    Goto /admin/Products/Products 
        see:
            look at all the products listed out nicely
cli: git add .
cli: git commit -m "customized admin"

So now we can see our products in the websites Django Admin page. Lets get a view so we can see them on the website's GUI like a user would
Goto products/views.py
    populate

Create products/url.py
    populate

Reference them in the project level urls
    goto boutique_ado/urls.py
        update with path to products url

Create a templates and inner products directory simultaneously  
    cli: mkdir -p products/templates/products
    create a products.html file
        populate with the header (from home template) and the products template variable in double curly braces
    cli: python3 manage.py runserver
    goto /products  
        see:
            big json file - looks ugly

cli: git add .
cli: git commit -m "added views and template"
cli: git push

goto products/templates/products/products.html and static/css/base.css
    populate with white overlay class
    
cli: python3 manage.py runserver 
    check the products page is white and has json data


gooto products/templates/products/products.html 
    populate

cli: git add .
cli: git commit -m "started product template"
cli: git push
